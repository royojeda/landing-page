# landing-page

I built a landing page from scratch, referring to a template image and following specifications regarding the appearance of text, background, images, and positions of the different elements using HTML and CSS with Flexbox. The page has sections for a header, hero text and image, information, quotes/testimonials, call to action, and a footer.

The skills demonstrated in this project (aside from those stated already in the odin-recipes project) are the following:
 - Linking an external CSS file to the web page
 - Using <div> to group HTML elements together for styling and positioning in CSS
 - Assigning classes to certain elements
 - Using different selectors to apply CSS styles to the correct elements
 - Applying several of the common CSS properties
 - Importing a web font using CSS for use in the web page
 - Growing or shrinking flex items as required
 - Justifying and aligning flex items as required on both row and column flex-directions
 - Nesting flex containers when needed
 - Combining margin, padding, and border properties with Flexbox
